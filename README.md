## Stage of development
This software should be considered to be in it's early stage of development. It is working without any known issues in a single installation. We are currently looking for people interested to contribute to this project. Please join the OH-Jython-Scripters team if you feel that you can contribute in any way. We need testers, developers, and native english speakers to give the [Wiki](https://github.com/OH-Jython-Scripters/ideAlarm/wiki) an overhaul.

In case you decide to install and try this software in it's current state, you should already have some skills when it comes to openHAB, jython scripting and the linux environment. 

## About
ideAlarm is written in Jython and runs on openHAB 2.

The name ideAlarm comes from merging the two words ideal and alarm.

Your home is your castle. Keeping it safe and secure is a top priority of many homeowners. With ideAlarm, you can easily set up your own DIY Home Security System using the sensors that you already have in Domoticz.
